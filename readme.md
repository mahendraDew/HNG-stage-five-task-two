**FRONTEND STAGE 5 TASK LIST :**

**Task 2: Build an On-Page Assistant** 

**Objective: Develop a proof-of-concept for an on-page assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page. This assistant should be a transparent, moving video (not an image) and provide helpful information to users.**

#### Requirements: 
1. Design and create an animated, transparent assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page. 
3. When a button is clicked on the page, the assistant should move to the button and explain what that button does. 
4. Implement a hover icon that, when pressed, allows the assistant to provide explanations for certain elements when users hover over them. 
5. For extra credit, add animations to make the assistant's movement to the button look natural and engaging. 
6. Explore the use of dynamic 3D effects for additional bonus points. 
7. Conduct research to find innovative techniques and technologies that can enhance the functionality and appearance of the assistant. 
#### Acceptance Criteria: 
1. The on-page assistant is integrated into the web page as a transparent, moving element. 
2. The assistant provides clear and helpful explanations when users click on buttons or hover over specific elements. 
3. When a button is clicked, the assistant smoothly moves to the button and delivers a concise explanation of its function. 
4. The hover icon is responsive and allows users to easily access explanations for relevant elements. 
5. Animations are implemented to enhance the assistant's movement to buttons and overall user experience. 
6. If dynamic 3D effects are attempted, they are well-executed and enhance the assistant's presentation. 
7. The assistant's appearance and behavior are in accordance with the provided design specifications. 
8. Users find the assistant's interactions intuitive and helpful. 
9. Any technical challenges or limitations are documented, and alternative solutions are explored as part of the research effort. 
10. The on-page assistant project is presented as a proof-of-concept with room for potential future enhancements based on user feedback.
